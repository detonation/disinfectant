# disinfectant
Python script to calculate alcohol, benzalkonium chloride, and water to make disinfectant.

Benzalkonium chloride is the active ingredient in most disinfectant wipes and sprays. It's also known as
alkyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride, and dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride, and various variants thereof.
I was able to find a 2% cleaning solution, while it's only neccessary in .1-.25% (a miniscule amount) in
most cleaners. 

This script is based on a 2% solution called Odoban that sells for $10/gallon at most hardware stores, and
requires dilution of 10:1 for typical cleaning. 

For the alcohol, isopropyl (first aid), or ethyl alcohol (drinking alcohol) is to be used. 
You set the percentage in the script of what you have on hand, and set what the percentage you want in the
final product, and it figures out the amount of water to add. 

Science seems to hint that percentages in the 65-70% range has higher biocidal activity than 91% or 100%
Most hand sanitizers are in the 60% range, and most spray disinfectants are in the 55-60% range.

DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH on what you need. This script lets you make the exact amount you want.
